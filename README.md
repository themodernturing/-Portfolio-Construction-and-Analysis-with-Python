# -Portfolio-Construction-and-Analysis-with-Python
The practice of investment management has been transformed by computational methods. In this analysis, I introduce the underlying science to provide a thorough understanding of the scientific basis. My emphasis is on practical implementation using Python programming.

I cover the basics of Investment Science and include practical implementations of each concept. Starting with the basics of risk and return, I progress to a range of topics, including several Nobel Prize-winning concepts and popular practical techniques in modern investment management and portfolio construction.

I cover theoretical and mathematical concepts and implement them in Python, allowing for a deep and practical understanding of the methods. By the end, you will have a foundational understanding of modern computational methods in investment management, along with practical mastery in their implementation.
